This is Another Free Implementation of Heating Element Thermostat e.g.
    Honeywell Rondostat - HR20(e)
    Aldi - Thermy Energiespar-Regler für Heizkörper
    EUROtronic - SPARmatic Basic
    EUROtronic - SPARmatic Zero

this project is not autonomous.
It relies on the ethersex implementation as the necessary basis.
Before going on with this project please download ethersex first.

If it doesn't work, you might want to write an e-mail to
<hr20@keyb.de>

Have fun!
